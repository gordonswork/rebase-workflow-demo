# rebase-workflow-demo
This repo is created to explain the idea of following the Git Workflow with Rebase. You can find the tutorial here (https://medium.com/@kalana.16/git-rebase-for-an-absolute-beginner-35d16144abd9)

This branch contains work which is not there in the master branch and this branch is not based on the latest version of the master branch. Therefore you have to rebase this branch before pushing its changes to the master.
